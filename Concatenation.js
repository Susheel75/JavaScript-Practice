// Concatenation
// The '+' sign can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string.
// This is called concatenation.
// For eg -

// var x = "Good";
// var y = "Work";
// console.log(x + y);   //output: GoodWork
// Note: You can add spaces between words by using an empty " " with a space inside or by providing a space at the end of a word.
// For eg -

// var x = "Good";
// var y = "Work";
// console.log(x + " " + y);   // output: Good Work
// Task
// Write a program which does the following

// Declare two variables x and y
// Assign the values Hello to variable x and World to variable y.
// Output x and y to the console. Don't forget to add a space in between them.
// Your output will be Hello World

var x = "Hello";
var y = "World";
console.log(x + " " + y);   // output: Hello World
